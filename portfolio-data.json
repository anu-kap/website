Using a mobile camera, hikers can snap a photo of an animal, which is then sent to a Flask backend. The backend stores sightings in a SQLite database via SQLAlchemy and runs a PyTorch neural network model (invoked via subprocess) to classify the animal and return the top prediction with confidence level. The app also logs GPS coordinates, timestamps, and base64-encoded images for each sighting, enabling features like a leaderboard of top wildlife reporters. Built with Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, and PyTorch, this project combines computer vision, geolocation tracking, and gamification to make wildlife exploration interactive and educational.",
